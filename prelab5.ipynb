        "\n",
        "To implement logic functions, you must understand how a decoder works. Read the lecture on decoders on Brightspace, once it's been published. If we haven't reached that point in lecture yet, read Lecture 2-G from the [notes](/ece270/notes) page on the website. Either one should make clear that a _decoder_ is a mechanism for taking a binary encoded input and making the corresponding output active. In the case of a 3-to-8 decoder, the 3-bit input code can have one of eight combinations. The _number_ that the input represents causes the output number to be active. In this regard, the eight outputs can be thought of as the minterm number. For instance, if the input to a 3-to-8 decoder is 011, it represents the decimal number three. The output three represents minterm 3. If the inputs represent symbols X,Y, and Z, then a 011 input would represent the product term X'\\*Y\\*Z. Each output represents the AND of each relevant literal component. Output 3 represents the AND of X', Y, and Z.\n",
        "\n",
        "You know that a sum-of-products representation of a logic function is the OR of the constituent minterms. For example, the expression X'\\*Y\\*Z + X\\*Y'\\*Z + X\\*Y\\*Z corresponds to the logical sum of minterms 3, 5, and 7. A three-input OR gate connected to those outputs of the decoder would implement the function."

A decoder with inverted outputs can be thought of as a NAND of the literal product components. If another NAND is used to \"sum\" multiple outputs together, the result is the NAND-NAND equivalent of the sum-of-products expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the previous example, to implement X'\\*Y\\*Z + X\\*Y'\\*Z + X\\*Y\\*Z, we know that a 3-to-8 decoder with active-low outputs represents (X'\\*Y\\*Z)' with output 3, (X\\*Y'\\*Z)' with output 5, and (X\\*Y\\*Z)' with output 7. By using an enclosing NAND for all three terms, we get:\n",

For instance, consider the case where two 74HC138 chips are used, with selection signals X,Y,Z connected to the 3 inputs of each. A fourth selection signal, W, could be added by connecting (0,W,1) to e1,e2,e3 of one chip, and connecting (0,0,W) to e1,e2,e3 of the second chip. This means that the first chip's outputs will be enabled when W is low (to make e2 active), and the second chip's outputs will be enabled when W is high (to make e3 active). The result is a 4-to-16 decoder, where the first chips eight outputs represent minterms 0 – 7, and the second chip's outputs represent minterms 8 – 15."
